    "\n",
    "### Introduction to BST\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a specialized binary tree data structure where each node has at most two children, commonly referred to as the left and right child. The key characteristics of a BST are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ordered Structure:** In a binary search tree , the left child and all its descendants have smaller values than the parent node, while the right child and all its descendants have larger values than the parent node.\n",
    "- **Efficient Operations:** This structure allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements in average-case time complexity of _O(log n)_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of BST\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search Operations:** Quickly find a value by following the tree’s order—left for smaller, right for larger.  \n",
    "- **Dynamic Data Handling:** Easily add or remove values while keeping everything in order.  \n",
    "- **Inorder Traversal:** Reading the tree from left to right gives a sorted list.  \n",
    "- **Indexing and Lookup:** Helps store and find data efficiently in databases and file systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Using a BST\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Fast search, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "- **Sorted Data:** Data is maintained in a sorted order, which is beneficial for operations like reporting or ranking.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Can be augmented or balanced (e.g., AVL or Red-Black trees) for even better performance in worst-case scenarios.\n",

    "## 2. How BST Works in Our Project\n",
    "\n",
    "In our **Students Exam Management System**, the BST is used to manage student records. Here’s the explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key by Student ID:** Each student is uniquely identified by their ID. The BST uses the student ID as the key.\n",
    "- **Insertion:** When a new student record is added, the BST places it in the correct location based on the student ID.\n",
    "- **Search:** The BST is traversed to quickly locate a student record based on the provided student ID.\n",
    "- **Deletion:** When a student record needs to be removed, the BST structure is adjusted accordingly to maintain its properties.\n",
    "- **Inorder Traversal:** To display all student records in ascending order by ID, an inorder traversal of the BST is performed.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **FeeSlabCalculator:**  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Determines the fee slab based on the student’s CGPA.\n",
    "   - **Advantage:** Decouples fee logic from student data, making changes easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DataValidator:**  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Validates the input data such as CGPA, attendance, and marks.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Student:**  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Represents the student entity, including personal data and computed values (like CGPA).\n",

    "### Steps Involved  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Input Collection:**  \n",
    "   - The system prompts for:  \n",

    "     - **Number of Subjects & Marks**  \n",
    "     - **Attendance Percentage**  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation:**  \n",
    "   - Ensures all values are within valid ranges:  \n",
    "     - **Marks:** 0–100  \n",
    "     - **CGPA:** Computed as (avg. marks) / 10, must be 0–10  \n",
    "     - **Attendance:** 0–100%  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Student Object Creation:**  \n",
    "   - A `Student` object is created after validation.  \n",
    "   - CGPA is calculated, and a fee slab is assigned.  \n",
    "\n",

    "## 1. Binary Search Tree (BST)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to BST\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a specialized binary tree data structure where each node has at most two children, commonly referred to as the left and right child. The key characteristics of a BST are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ordered Structure:** In a binary search tree , the left child and all its descendants have smaller values than the parent node, while the right child and all its descendants have larger values than the parent node.\n",
    "- **Efficient Operations:** This structure allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements in average-case time complexity of _O(log n)_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of BST\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search Operations:** Quickly find a value by following the tree’s order—left for smaller, right for larger.  \n",
    "- **Dynamic Data Handling:** Easily add or remove values while keeping everything in order.  \n",
    "- **Inorder Traversal:** Reading the tree from left to right gives a sorted list.  \n",
    "- **Indexing and Lookup:** Helps store and find data efficiently in databases and file systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Using a BST\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Fast search, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "- **Sorted Data:** Data is maintained in a sorted order, which is beneficial for operations like reporting or ranking.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Can be augmented or balanced (e.g., AVL or Red-Black trees) for even better performance in worst-case scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. How BST Works in Our Project\n",
    "\n",
    "In our **Students Exam Management System**, the BST is used to manage student records. Here’s the explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key by Student ID:** Each student is uniquely identified by their ID. The BST uses the student ID as the key.\n",
    "- **Insertion:** When a new student record is added, the BST places it in the correct location based on the student ID.\n",
    "- **Search:** The BST is traversed to quickly locate a student record based on the provided student ID.\n",
    "- **Deletion:** When a student record needs to be removed, the BST structure is adjusted accordingly to maintain its properties.\n",
    "- **Inorder Traversal:** To display all student records in ascending order by ID, an inorder traversal of the BST is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagram: BST Operations in the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simplified diagram that illustrates how the BST is structured and how it handles insertion, deletion, and inorder traversal.\n",

    "## 3. Priority Queue for Ranking Students\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use a Priority Queue?\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the BST, our project also leverages a **Priority Queue** to manage student rankings based on their CGPA. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Ranking:** The priority queue is designed to quickly retrieve the student with the highest CGPA. This is ideal for ranking because the highest priority (i.e., highest CGPA) is always at the front.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Updates:** When student records are added or deleted, the priority queue automatically reorders to reflect the current ranking.\n",
    "- **Comparator Logic:** Our implementation uses a custom comparator that orders students in descending order by CGPA. In the case of ties, the student ID is used to break the tie.\n",
    "  \n",
    "By using the priority queue, the system can efficiently display the top-ranking students without the need to sort the entire dataset repeatedly.\n",
